              A job in the digital industry is boring and static? Nothing could
              be further from the truth. It is colorful, different and even
              creative. People from all over the world come together to think of
              new solutions and test them everyday. So the digital industry is
              always changing - with new positions, challenges and more freedom
              than in other branches. Companies that want to remain competitive
              have to join and change themselves as well. For that they need
              experts - and this is your chance.

              Agentur für Arbeit or the Jobcenter. They cover the costs and you
              do not have to pay back even a cent! Want to learn more about all
