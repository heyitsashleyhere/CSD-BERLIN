            <h3>Start your journey to your new future at DCI</h3>
            <p>
              A job in the digital industry is boring and static? Nothing could
              be further from the truth. It is colorful, different and even
              creative. People from all over the world come together to think of
              new solutions and test them everyday. So the digital industry is
              always changing - with new positions, challenges and more freedom
              than in other branches. Companies that want to remain competitive
              have to join and change themselves as well. For that they need
              experts - and this is your chance.
            </p>

              We are convinced that everyone should have the same chances and
              opportunities regardless of their gender, age or background. At
              DCI we support each other to become the best version of ourselves.
              To give everyone an equal start all our courses can be funded by a
              Bildungsgutschein (education voucher) from the Agentur für Arbeit
              or the Jobcenter. That means: They cover the full costs, you don’t
              have to pay anything and later do not have to pay it back either.
              For you it is 100% free of charge. More to that you can learn on
              our course page.
